Hi! I'm Angelo Ballesteros, a student in CPE 311 - Computational Thinking with Python. This subject is part of the Data Science elective. 
Please read this readme file first before opening the other files. 
I was tasked to create a data analysis of a dataset, and I have chosen the dataset of Valorant Champions LA 2023 stats of the players. 
I created a Python notebook about this dataset and if you want to look on it, go to the Notebook Link file. I also uploaded the PDF file of this notebook.
Lastly, I have provided a simple presentation of my findings for the dataset.
